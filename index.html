      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I’m a full stack developer with expertise in data analytics and visualization, QA testing and debugging, product development, process engineering, and project management.  Technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, XML, R, VBA, MySQL, MongoDB, Laravel, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Chrome DevTools, big data analysis, statistics and experimental design, Lean Six Sigma, biology, chemistry, and food science.  Soft skills include project management, department management, change management, stress management, conflict resolution, risk assessment and management, leadership, coaching and mentoring, teaching, people development, working with different cultures and languages, public speaking, writing, marketing, customer service, quality assurance and control, auditing, detail orientation, critical thinking, business strategy, administration, and research.</p>
      <p>For over 15 years, I was a quality control/quality assurance and R&D professional in manufacturing, warehouse, and laboratory operations.  I’ve been on a management level for the past 6 years.  As a Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt, I’ve also done project consulting and professional training in project management, operational excellence, statistical analysis, experimental design, and quality management.  I’ve worked with a variety of quality management schemes such as ISO, HACCP, BAP, GlobalGAP, AWS (American Welding Society), IDFB, and AZA.  Additionally, I’ve been responsible for compliance with local, state, federal, and international governmental regulations.  Not only have I been a department manager with direct reports, but I’ve also been a project manager for several local and global cross-functional projects, many projects involving multiple countries.  Projects have involved big data analysis for production improvement, designing and implementing quality management systems, engineering operational processes and quality testing methods, developing new products, conducting root cause analyses and implementing corrective action, and conducting scientific experiments and research.  I’ve led or participated in projects involving Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Holland, Norway, Turkey, USA, Vietnam, and Zambia.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Utah but have lived all over the world in places such as California, Texas, China, and Norway.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I absolutely love playing with my daughter!  Additionally, I enjoy audio/visual production, performing, video games, word and puzzle games, soccer, and fishing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I dream of managing a technical team or organization in a respectful environment with a company that values a good work/life balance.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web-based software programs are an integral part of any organization.  In my past work, I’ve seen how detrimental it is when software is not user-friendly or designed for efficient business operations.  I have extensive experience working with IT Departments to troubleshoot and improve ERP, MES, CRM, Business Intelligence, database, labeling, and formulation software solutions to ensure they meet the end-user’s needs.  This covered local software solutions as well as global solutions for a major multinational corporation.  Having been on the user-end with expertise in what is needed on the business side, I’ve decided to switch to the developer-end so I can help create solutions that work efficiently.</p>
